# str: tuples separated by semi-colon
# Each tuple is a network link, host-switch or switch-switch.
# Format of each tuple is (linkID, node1, node2), linkIDs should be integers starting at 1.
# It is recommended that switch-switch links are specified first, followed by switch-host links.
# B4 example:
links: (1,s1,s10);(2,s2,s10);(3,s3,s10);(4,s4,s11);(5,s5,s11);(6,s6,s11);(7,s7,s12);(8,s8,s12);(9,s9,s12);(10,s10,s13);(11,s11,s13);(12,s12,s13);(13,h1,s1);(14,h2,s2);(15,h3,s3);(16,h4,s4);(17,h5,s5);(18,h6,s6);(19,h7,s7);(20,h8,s8);(21,h9,s9);(22,h10,s10);(23,h11,s11);(24,h12,s12);(25,h13,s13)
