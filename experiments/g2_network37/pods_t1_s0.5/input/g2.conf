# str: tuples separated by semi-colon
# Each tuple is a network link, host-switch or switch-switch.
# Format of each tuple is (linkID, node1, node2), linkIDs should be integers starting at 1.
# It is recommended that switch-switch links are specified first, followed by switch-host links.
# B4 example:
links: (1,h1,s1);(2,h2,s1);(3,h3,s2);(4,h4,s2);(5,s3,s1);(6,s3,s2);(7,s17,s3);(8,s18,s3);(9,s4,s1);(10,s4,s2);(11,s19,s4);(12,s20,s4);(13,h5,s5);(14,h6,s5);(15,h7,s6);(16,h8,s6);(17,s7,s5);(18,s7,s6);(19,s17,s7);(20,s18,s7);(21,s8,s5);(22,s8,s6);(23,s19,s8);(24,s20,s8);(25,h9,s9);(26,h10,s9);(27,h11,s10);(28,h12,s10);(29,s11,s9);(30,s11,s10);(31,s17,s11);(32,s18,s11);(33,s12,s9);(34,s12,s10);(35,s19,s12);(36,s20,s12);(37,h13,s13);(38,h14,s13);(39,h15,s14);(40,h16,s14);(41,s15,s13);(42,s15,s14);(43,s17,s15);(44,s18,s15);(45,s16,s13);(46,s16,s14);(47,s19,s16);(48,s20,s16);
